# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project is one of my projects in AI as an intern in Smart Methods, in this project will detect faces in photos or videos using Python and OpenCV

In the beginning, what is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.


Start using this command:

    pip3 install opencv-python
Runing the code:

    python facedetection_vedio.py
    python facedetection_image.py

    
After running the code, it will detect faces as shown below:
